# Fancy List Polymer Element

This project defines a simple polymer 2 element project and a polymer 2 app project.

The element project defines the element (`<fancy-list></fancy-list>`)

The app project is an application which consumes the element.

To get started, `cd` into each project and type `polymer install`.

> Note: requires `polymer-cli` installed

Next, `cd` into the app project and type `polymer serve`. This will host a webpage at `http://localhost:8081/` by default.
